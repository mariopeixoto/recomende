   <dc:subject>Gabriele Scheler 36 Problems for Semantic Interpretation</dc:subject>
   <dc:description>This paper presents a collection of problems for natural language analysis
derived mainly from theoretical linguistics. Most of these problems
present major obstacles for computational systems of language interpretation.
The set of given sentences can easily be scaled up by introducing more
examples per problem. The construction of computational systems could
benefit from such a collection, either using it directly for training and
testing or as a set of benchmarks to qualify the performance of a NLP
system.
1 Introduction
The main part of this paper consists of a collection of problems for semantic
analysis of natural language. The problems are arranged in the following way:
example sentences
concise description of the problem
keyword for the type of problem
The sources (first appearance in print) of the sentences have been left out,
because they are sometimes hard to track and will usually not be of much use,
as they indicate a starting-point of discussion only. The keywords howeve...</dc:description>

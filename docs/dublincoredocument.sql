The network can be characterised as a competitive-cooperative-competitive architecture by virtue of the contrast enhancing properties of the pseudoinverse subnets. The network is capable of fast learning. The adopted learning method gives rise to increased sampling in the vicinity of dubious boundary regions that resembles the phenomenon of categorical perception. The generalising abilities of the scheme allow one to utilise single bit connection strengths.

This paper is part of a general attempt to develop a coherent understanding of the implications and potentials of ubiquitous computing in the context of everyday city life. On a more specific level the paper examines how the notion of social friction can be helpful in the development and analysis of ubiquitous computing in relation to art and design. Social friction is articulated as a critical position, which could be applied as a strategy for design. Our approach consists of a theoretical analysis and precedes concrete development and real-life experiments. As such the paper aims to establish a steppingstone from which to launch actual digital designs. We argue that by designing for the social friction, which is an intrinsic characteristic of everyday life, new forms of social and cultural potentials can be released.

Both the supply of raw materials and   the export of finished products occur through ships loading   and unloading at the jetty. Since disruptions in the plants  production process are very expensive, buffer stock is  needed to allow for variations in ship arrivals and overseas  exports through large ships.   Ports provide jetty facilities for ships to load and unload  their cargo. Since ship delays are costly, terminal operators  attempt to minimize their number and duration. Here, simulation  has proved to be a very suitable tool. However, in port  simulation models, the impact of the arrival process of ships  on the model outcomes tends to be underestimated. This article  considers three arrival processes: stock-controlled,   equidistant per ship type, and Poisson. We assess how their  deployment in a port simulation model, based on data from a  real case study, affects the efficiency of the loading and  unloading process. Poisson, which is the chosen arrival  process in many client-oriented simulations, actually performs worst in terms of both ship delays and required storage capacity. Stock-controlled arrivals perform best with regard to ship delays and required storage capacity.   In the case study two types of arrival processes were  considered.

In order to classify a packet as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. In general, there have been two major threads of research addressing packet classification: algorithmic and architectural. A few pioneering groups of researchers posed the problem, provided complexity bounds, and offered a collection of algorithmic solutions. Subsequently, the design space has been vigorously explored by many offering new algorithms and improvements upon existing algorithms. Given the inability of early algorithms to meet performance constraints imposed by high speed links, researchers in industry and academia devised architectural solutions to the problem. This thread of research produced the most widely-used packet classification device technology, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). New architectural research combines intelligent algorithms and novel architectures to eliminate many of the unfavorable characteristics of current TCAMs. We observe that the community appears to be converging on a combined algorithmic and architectural approach to the problem.

Czech vowel length has been extensively studied since the 19th century.  However, no generalisation of any kind could be uncovered. Diachronically, it does not relate to either Indo-European  or Common Slavic vowel length, nor does it show any kinship with Baltic tones and East/ South Slavic accent.  Synchronically, closed syllable shortening (krva vs. krav, kravka &quot;cow NOMsg, GENpl, dim&quot;) appears to coexist with  closed syllable lengthening (n# vs. noe, n#ky &quot;knife NOMsg, GENsg, scissors&quot;). In sum, any attempt to propose a  regularity underlying this system seems desperate. Vowel length in Czech is therefore reputed to be anarchic and  unpredictable. This situation is mirrored in grammars by pages of amorphous lists of grammatical categories that exhibit  length or shortness.   Czech vowel length is driven by a simple mechanism that is known from other languages: templates. That is, a  certain amount of vocalic space is associated to a given morphological and/ or semantic category. If concatenation of  underlying long and short vowels produces more morae than the specific category allows for, shortening is observed. If  it produces less vocalic weight than the category at stake demands, lengthening ensues.

In particular, a cache can be viewed roughly as a low-pass filter with its cutoff frequency equal to the inverse of the characteristic time. Documents with access frequencies lower than this cutoff frequency have good chances to pass through the cache without cache hits. This viewpoint enables us to take any branch of the cache tree as a tandem of low-pass filters at different cutoff frequencies, which further results in the finding of two fundamental design principles. Finally, to demonstrate how to use the principles to guide the caching algorithm design, we propose a cooperative hierarchical web caching architecture based on these principles.

The introduction of new export crops, such as snow peas, broccoli, and miniature vegetables, has led to yet another agro-export boom. Unlike earlier booms, however, this one has included all but the smallest farmers. The high rate of smallholder participation in the boom, and the initial high profitability of nontraditional exports (NTXs), fueled initial optimism that NTX production could increase smallholders&apos; ability to accumulate land and so decrease the highly skewed distribution of land in Guatemala, a country with one of the most unequal landholding patterns in all of Latin America. The picture that emerges from the analysis in this paper raises serious questions about the sustainability and equity effects of NTX crop adoption among smallholders in the long run. Two main findings illustrate the problems besetting NTX crop production. First, the land accumulation rates of adopters have dropped dramatically in the 1990s. NTX crop adopters accumulated close to three times more land than non-adopters in the 1980s. Although adopters are still accumulating more land than non-adopters in the 1990s, the gap between the two groups has narrowed substantially. Second, smaller adopters are no longer accumulating land at higher rates than their larger counterparts. In the 1980s the landholdings of smaller adopters grew significantly faster than those of the larger adopters, but this trend reversed itself in the iii 1990s.

Watershed projects are complicated, however, by the fact that watershed boundaries rarely correspond to human-defined boundaries. Also, watershed projects often distribute costs and benefits unevenly, with costs incurred disproportionately upstream, typically among poorer residents, and benefits realized disproportionately downstream, where irrigation is concentrated and the wealthiest farmers own most of the land. Watershed projects take a wide variety of strategies, ranging from those that are more technocratic to those that pay more attention to the social organization of watersheds. By the mid-1990s annual expenditure on watershed development in India approached $500 million, but there was relatively little information available on the success of different project approaches. This study addresses three main research questions: 1) What projects are most successful in promoting the objectives of raising agricultural productivity, improving natural resource management and reducing poverty? 2) What approaches enable them to succeed? 3) What nonproject factors also contribute to achieving these objectives? The major hypotheses are that participat...', null, 'application/pdf', 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.1643', 'en', '', '10.1.1.31.1619', 'Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it.', 'http://www.ifpri.org/divs/eptd/dp/papers/eptdp68.pdf', null, 'ACKNOWLEDGMENTS', '3');

Among different categories of these sensors is the Extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) sensor which is inherently simple and requires only modest amount of interface electronics. These advantages make it suitable for many practical applications. Investigating a cost-effective, reliable and repeatable method for optical fiber sensor fabrication is challenging work. In this thesis, a system for controlled fabrication of FabryPerot optical fiber sensors is developed and presented as the first attempt for the long-term goal of automated EFPI sensor fabrication. The sensor fabrication control system presented here implements a real-time control of a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) laser as sensor bonding power, an optical fiber white light interferometric subsystem for real-time monitoring and measurement of the air gap separation in the Fabry-Perot sensor probe, and real-time control of a piezoelectric (PZT) motion subsystem for sensor alignment. The design of optoelectronic hardware and computer software is included. A large number of sensors are fabricated using this system and are tested under high temperature and high pressure. This system as a prototype system shows the potential in automated sensor fabrication.

Todays speech synthesis systems are able to achieve better performancesthan older systems, but the produced speech do not appear as natural as human voice. Those systems are already able to synthesize speech almost perfect on the segmental point of view: most of the artefact of former synthesizer are not present anymore. Further improvements can only come from a better implementation of prosody in future system. New systems have to be able to take under control intonation, tempo and loudness of voice in order to obtain the most natural speech. Also automatic speech recognition systems make a poor use of prosodic features. Speaker independency and noise robustness are not the only challenge of future recognition systems. Further improvement can derive from a better processing of prosody: todays systems require too much effort from the user to keep tempo and loudness constant. Those systems are thus not able to deal with spontaneous speech. In this work some prosodic processing tools will be shown. An application of these tools will be the extraction on prosodic features to be used as input in automatic recognition, and the automatic prosodic labelling of corpora for speech synthesis purpose. In the first chapter of this thesis a very fast introduction to prosody will be given, the most important similar systems described in literature will be shown and motivations for this work will be discussed. The second chapter will show original algorithms for prosodic analysis developed by the author. Most of the routines, used in this work, crucially rely on the proper choice of a number of parameter.

The problem is essentially reduced to a minimization of an n-variable function. Processing time of these tools will be reduced by using distributed computing.

This paper describes improved methods for extracting good quality terrain models from topographic contour maps, which despite modern techniques are still the most available form of elevation information. Recent work on the automatic reconstruction of curves from point samples, and the generation of medial axis transforms (skeletons) has greatly helped in the visualization of the relationships between sets of boundaries, and families of curves. The insertion of skeleton points guarantees the elimination of all flat triangles. Additional assumptions about the local uniformity of slopes give us enough information to assign elevation values to these skeleton points. Various interpolation techniques were compared using visualization of the enriched contour data.

However, the modularity of the architecture of middleware is starting to disintegrate and to become complicated due to the interaction of too many orthogonal concerns imposed from a wide range of application requirements. This is not due to bad design but rather due to the limitations of the conventional architectural decomposition methodologies. We introduce the principles of horizontal decomposition (HD) to address this problem with a mixed-paradigm middleware architecture. HD provides guidance for the use of conventional decomposition methods to implement the core functionalities of middleware and the use of aspect orientation to address its orthogonal properties. Our evaluation of the horizontal decomposition principles focuses on refactoring major middleware functionalities into aspects in order to modularize and isolate them from the core architecture. New versions of the middleware platform can be created through combining the core and the flexible selection of middleware aspects such as IDL data types, the oneway invocation style, the dynamic messaging style, and additional character encoding schemes. As a result, the primary functionality of the middleware is supported with a much simpler architecture and enhanced performance.

Traditional cache architectures, with fixed sizes and discrete latencies, lock one organization down at design time, which will provide inferior performance across a range of workloads. In addition, expected increases in on-chip communication delays will make the time to retrieve data in a cache a function of the data&apos;s physical location. Consequently, cache access times will become a continuum of latencies rather than a single one. This non-uniformity will make static organizations particularly limited for single-chip servers, in which multiple processors will be different distances from the cache controller. In this paper, we propose a set of adaptive, high-performance cache design, called Non-Uniform Cache Architectures (NUCAs). We extend these physical designs with logical policies that allow important data to migrate closer to the processor within the same cache.

Overall, they can be partitioned into three broad classes: (1) source routing, (2) distributed routing and (3) hierarchical routing algorithms. In this paper we give an overview of the QoS routing problem as well as the existing solutions. We present the strengths and the weaknesses of different routing strategies and outline the challenges. We also discuss the basic algorithms in each class, classify and compare them, and point out possible future directions in the QoS routing area.', null, null, 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.1727', 'en', '', '10.1.1.16.5930', 'Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it.', '', null, 'An Overview of Quality-of-Service Routing for the Next Generation High-Speed Networks: Problems and Solutions', '3');

Vowels with std are as long as long vowels without std, and both are 50-70% longer than short vowels. Std vowels are also found to equal long vowels perceptually, though this similarity may be overshadowed by the similarity between syllables with std, irrespective of vowel length.  2.

This paper reports on progress in developing a summary measure of infant and child  feeding practices that addresses the following two challenges: infant and child feeding is  multidimensional, and appropriate practices vary by age of the child. Much previous  research in the area of infant and child feeding has focused on single practices over a  narrow age range and so has not addressed the determinants and impact of adequate or  optimal infant and child feeding.  Using data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, an infant and child  feeding index is constructed, summarizing a range of key practices, including  breastfeeding, bottle use, feeding frequency, and diet diversity. Because it provides agespecific scoring and incorporates various practices, the index is a useful analytic tool.  The index is associated with an indicator of child growth (height-for-age) in  bivariate and multivariate analyses. Examination of individual indicators shows that this  association is driven by a strong positive association between one componentdiet  diversityand height-for-age. Further work is required to establish the nature of the  relationship between infant and child feeding indicators, nutrient adequacy, growth, and  other outcomes. But because it can be used to illustrate the association between a set of  recommended practices and growth, the index may serve as a communication tool with  policymakers.    iii Simulations show that the index accurately reflects an averaging of changes in  individual component practices, and so it may also be of use to program managers who  seek a summary measure for assessing p...', null, 'application/pdf', 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.1732', 'en', '', '10.1.1.31.5529', 'Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it.', 'http://www.ifpri.org/divs/fcnd/dp/papers/fcndp143.pdf', null, 'FCND DP No.143', '3');

However, none of the existing key management schemes are suitable for ad hoc networks.

Recent research on distributed sensor networks suggests that key pre-distribution schemes (KPS) are the only practical option for scenarios where the network topology is not known prior to deployment. However, all of the existing KPS schemes rely on trusted third parties (TTP) rendering them inapplicable in many ad hoc networking scenarios and thus restricting them from wide-spread use in ad hoc networks. To eliminate this reliance on TTP, we introduce distributed key pre-distribution scheme (DKPS) and construct the first DKPS prototype to realize fully distributed and selforganized key pre-distribution without relying on any infrastructure support. DKPS overcomes the main limitations of the previous schemes, namely the needs of TTP and an established routing infrastructure. It minimizes the requirements posed on the underlying networks and can be easily applied to the ad hoc networking scenarios where key pre-distribution schemes were previously inapplicable.

In this paper we illustrate that one needs to be careful in implementing such an approach because there are tradeoffs to be addressed that arise due to traffic dynamics. We demonstrate that Internet flows are very volatile in terms of volume, and may substantially change the volume of traffic they transmit as time evolves. Currently proposed schemes for flow classification, although attractive due to their simplicity, face challenges due to this property of flows. Bandwidth volatility impacts the amount of load captured in a set of flows, which usually drops both significantly and quickly after flow classification is performed. Thus if the goal is to capture a large fraction of traffic consistently over time, flows will need to be reselected often. Our first contribution is in understanding the impact of flow volatility on the classification schemes employed in a traffic engineering context. Our second contribution is to propose a classification scheme that is capable of addressing the issues identified above by incorporating historical flow information.

Previous work in this area focused on increasing bandwidth efficiency and reliability. In this work, in addition to increasing the bandwidth efficiency, we address the complexity of network management and operations. This issue is explicitly addressed by our novel framework, a simple polynomial time algorithm (SimPol)that  achieves optimum network performance (in terms of congestion or bandwidth consumption) using only a small number of paths. The problem formulation is based on splittable multicommodity flows. Using SimPol we show that the total number of paths is at most k + m,wherek and m are the numbers of demands and edges in the network, respectively. We extend the basic framework into an integer programming formulation to address the tradeoff between network congestion and the total number of paths. We also use SimPol to address the problem of implementing path/link policies such as bandwidth-limited paths. The performance of SimPol is evaluated through extensive simulations. We find that for large number of demands the LPbased framework provides a near-optimal solution of almost one path per demand. Using the integer programming approach, we can get exactly one path while losing about 10% to 50% in congestion depending on the number of demands.

The main mechanism for achieving fast restoration is by locally routing around failures using pre-setup detour paths. Signaling and routing protocol extensions to implement this local bypass ability are currently being standardized. To make use of this ability, dynamic schemes that jointly route primary paths and all link detours for links used by the primary paths have been previously proposed. These schemes also permit sharing of reserved restoration capacity for achieving efficiency. However, this joint computation places a significantly larger computational load on the network elements than that imposed by the shortest path computation variants typically used for unprotected network connection routing. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that is operationally much simpler, shares capacity used for restoration, and permits the network to route the primary paths in a manner that is oblivious to restoration needs. Restoration of all carried traffic is guaranteed by a new link capacity partitioning scheme that maximizes the working capacity of the network without requiring any knowledge of the traffic that will be imposed on the network. Being traffic independent for a priori link capacity partitioning and being oblivious to restoration needs for on-line network routing makes this scheme operationally simple and desirable in the sense of placing no additional routing load on the constrained computing resources at the network nodes.

CTLs play an important role in the control of infectious agents, and they are essential components of our defense against HIV, cancer, and other diseases of great public interest. Immunologists are interested in manipulating and enhancing the CTL response to these diseases, whether by vaccination or drug therapy, but the process can be difficult and ad hoc. A combination of animal experimentation, limited human testing, and simple mathematical models have been the primary sources of guidance in the efforts to address these diseases. Computer models provide an alternative strategy for exploring immune system therapies. Recently developed laboratory techniques that have revealed and quantified many aspects of CTL behavior provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop detailed models. The model used in this work integrates many of these new findings into a coherent system that simulates an immune response to viral infection. This model reproduces many of the phenomena seen in CTL responses but not captured by other mathematical or computer models and can be used to explore vaccination strategies. The value of modeling goes beyond simply making predictions. It allows one to perform experiments difficult, or even impossible, to perform in the laboratory. For example, in a computer model one can replicate experiments exactly or choose to allow stochastic fluctuations to influence the outcome. In biological systems, achieving this level of control is impossible. Model-building can also be used as a vehicle for hypothesis testing by formulating one s assumptions about a system s behavior as a model.

A driving force behind this growth was the development of multipoint audio, video, and shared whiteboard conferencing applications. Because these real-time media are transmitted at a uniform rate to all of the receivers in the network, a source must either run at the bottleneck rate or overload portions of its multicast distribution tree. We overcome this limitation by moving the burden of rate adaptation from the source to the receivers with a scheme we call receiver-driven layered multicast, or RLM. In RLM, a source distributes a hierarchical signal by striping the different layers across multiple multicast groups, and receivers adjust their reception rate by simply joining and leaving multicast groups. In this paper, we describe a layered video compression algorithm which, when combined with RLM, provides a comprehensive solution for scalable multicast video transmission in heterogeneous networks. In addition to a layered representation, our coder has low complexity (admitting an efficient software implementation) and high loss resilience (admitting robust operation in loosely controlled environments like the Internet) . Even with these constraints, our hybrid DCT/wavelet-based coder exhibits good compression performance. It outperforms all publicly available Internet video codecs while maintaining comparable run-time performance.

The control problem is posed as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and is solved heuristically using a technique called Hindsight Optimization.

The main task, besides segmentation of the raw scan point data into polylines and denoising, is to find corresponding environmental features in consecutive scans to merge the polylinedata to a global map. The correspondence problem is solved using shape similarity between the polylines. The approach does not require any odometry data and is robust to discontinuities in robot position, e.g., when the robot slips. Since higher order objects in the form of polylines and their shape similarity are present in our approach, it provides a link between the necessary low-level and the desired high-level information in robot navigation.

The proposed approach relies on the joint exploitation of variable-bit-rate (VBR) multicarrier code-division multiplexing (MC-CDM), together with MPEG4 coding with Fine-Grain-Scalability (FGS) in order to provide unequal error protection to the transmitted video stream. The innovative scheme proposed employs a shared bandwidth partitioned into orthogonal sub-channels in order to multiplex different layers of MPEG-4-coded signals. The highest number of subchannels (and hence an increased frequency diversity) is assigned to the lowest-bit-rate base layer and the lowest number of sub-channels is assigned to the highest bit-rate enhancement layer. In such a way, base layer information contents are more protected against channel degradations than information contained in FGS enhancement layers, which can only yield a refinement of the quality of the decoded streams. A 2GHz LEO multicast satellite transmission to mobile users has been regarded as the application testbed for the proposed method. Results achieved in terms of PSNR point out that the VBR MC-CDM technique can provide better results than a conventional MPEG-4 single-layer MC-SS transmission.

For example, a particular type of transaction may satisfy a constraint that an attribute of an object must be greater after the transaction than it was before the transaction.

Existing studies so far have focused on the design of differentiated media access algorithms. Some QoS metrics, such as queueing delay can not be completely addressed by these approaches. Moreover, without a formalized service differentiation goal that quantifies the outcome of differentiation, the performance of most approaches fluctuates, especially in short time-scales. This paper addresses above problems by introducing the concept of proportional service differentiation, to the domain of wireless network and focuses on providing proportional delay differentiation in wireless LANs. Due to the unique characteristic of distributed medium sharing, the 1 scheduling algorithm employed in wireline networks can not be applied directly to the context of wireless LANs. We argue that delay differentiation in wireless LAN can only be achieved through a joint packet scheduling at the network layer and distributed coordination at the MAC layer. Therefore, we present a cross-layer waiting time priority scheduling (CWTP) algorithm. CWTP consists of two tiers: an intra-node WTP scheduler at the network layer and an inter-node distributed coordination function at the MAC layer. These two tiers coordinate via a mapping function which maps the normalized waiting time at the network layer to the backoff time at the MAC layer. Two mapping schemes, namely linear mapping and piecewise linear mapping, are presented and evaluated in this paper.

These solutions, known as a-stable distributions, are the result of a generalized central limit theorem which describes the behavior of sums of finite or infinite-variance random variables. We use this limit theorem in a model which sums the length of particle jumps during their random walk through a heterogeneous porous medium.

Currently, most of the research on OBS (e.g., burst scheduling and assembly algorithms) has been concentrated on reducing burst loss in an &quot;average-case&quot; sense. Little effort has been devoted to understanding the worst-case performance. Since OBS itself is an open-loop control system, it may often exhibit a worst-case behavior when adversely synchronized, thus a poor worst-case performance can lead to an unacceptable system-wide performance. In this paper, we use competitive analysis to analyze the worstcase performance of a large set of scheduling algorithms, called best-effort online scheduling algorithms, for OBS networks, and establish a number of interesting upper and lower bounds on the performance of such algorithms. Our analysis shows that the performance of any best-effort online algorithm is closely related to a few factors, such as the range of offset time, burst length ratio, scheduling algorithm, and number of data channels. A surprising discovery is that the worst-case performance of any best-effort online scheduling algorithm is primarily determined by the maximum to minimum burst length ratio, followed by the range of offset time. Furthermore, if all bursts have the same burst length and offset time, all best-effort online scheduling algorithms generate the same optimal solution, regardless how different they may look like. Our analysis can also be extended to some non-besteffort online scheduling algorithms, such as the well-known Horizon algorithm, and establish similar bounds.

In the hypercube there is a range of failure probabilities in which short paths exist with high probability, yet finding them must involve querying essentially the entire network. Thus the routing complexity of the hypercube shows an asymptotic phase transition. The critical probability with respect to routing complexity lies in a different location then that of the critical probability with respect to connectivity.

The tool can also modify an existing application to use the prototype generated by the interpreter instead of a hand-coded implementation. The tool improves the usability of algebraic specifications in the following ways: (i) A programmer can “run ” an algebraic specification to study its behavior. The tool reports in which way a specification is incomplete for a client application. (ii) The tool can check whether a specification and a hand-coded implementation behave the same for a particular run of a client application. (iii) A prototype can be used when a hand-coded implementation is not yet available. Two case studies demonstrate how to use the tool. 1.', null, 'application/pdf', 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.1924', 'en', 'IEEE Computer Society Press', '10.1.1.154.6505', 'Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it.', 'http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/reading-group/henkel04algebraic.pdf', null, 'A Tool for Writing and Debugging Algebraic Specifications', '3');

Emerging overlay and peer-to-peer (p2p) networks open the door for new paradigms of network FEC. The deployment of FEC within these emerging networks has received very little attention (if any). In this paper, we analyze and optimize the impact of Network-Embedded FEC (NEF) in overlay and p2p multimedia multicast networks. Under NEF, we place FEC codecs in selected intermediate nodes of a multicast tree. The NEF codecs detect and recover lost packets within FEC blocks at earlier stages before these blocks arrive at deeper intermediate nodes or at the final leaf nodes. This approach significantly reduces the probability of receiving undecodable FEC blocks. In essence, the proposed NEF codecs work as signal regenerators in a communication system and can reconstruct most of the lost data packets without requiring retransmission. We develop an optimization algorithm for the placement of NEF codecs within random multicast trees. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that a relatively small number of NEF codecs placed in (sub-)optimally selected intermediate nodes of a network can improve the throughput and overall reliability dramatically.', null, 'application/pdf', 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.1957', 'en', '', '10.1.1.90.9900', 'Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it.', 'http://www.egr.msu.edu/waves/people/Radha_files/2004/ICIP04_p2p.pdf', null, 'Overlay and Peer-to-Peer Multimedia Multicast with Network-Embedded FEC', '3');

What are the key contextual factors, institutional arrangements,  capacity elements, and processes related to successful scaling-up of CDD, and,  conversely, what are the main constraints or limiting factors, in different contexts?  Drawing upon recent literature and the findings from five case studies, key lessons on  how best to stimulate, facilitate, and support the scaling-up of CDD in different  situations, along with some major challenges, are highlighted.  Lessons include the need for donors and supporters of CDD, including  governments, to think of the process beyond the project, and of transformation or  transition rather than exit.

Much empirical work has approached the problem from the perspective that if preferences differ, welfare outcomes will depend on the power of individuals within the household to exert their own preferences. Measures of power are therefore a central component of quantitative empirical approaches to understanding how differences in preferences translate into different welfare outcomes. Following most of the empirical studies in this genre, this paper focuses on dynamics within couples, although we recognize that dynamics among extended family members and across generations are of substantial interest. A number of different measures of power have been used in the literature. Because control over economic resources is seen as an important source of power, individual labor income, which one earns and so presumably controls to some degree, is one potential measure of power. However, whether and how much one works is a choice that is not likely to be independent of one&apos;s power in the household. Non- labor income has also been used as a measure of power, but even if non- labor income does not reflect contemporaneous choices, it likely does reflect past choices, particularly labor supply choices, and so is also a function of power. Levels of resources brought to the marriage by each spouse, over which they may individually retain control, are even less proximate to the current choices of household members, but nevertheless reflect one&apos;s taste in iii partners and therefore may not be exogenous to power.

The bivariate associations typical in a poverty profile can sometimes be misleading; they beg the obvious question of the effect of a particular variable conditional on the other potential determinants. While there may be certain contexts where unconditional poverty profiles are relevant to a policy decision (see Ravallion 1996), often one would be interested in the &quot;conditional&quot; poverty effects of proposed policy interventions.

For Egypt, while there has been some work on a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the poor, to our knowledge, there is no precursor to an empirical modeling of the determinants of poverty using nationally representative data.

The derived results are used to guide the execution of the proposed version decision policy and service admission control scheme to achieve the given QoS requirement. To measure the performance of QTP, several experiments are conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more scalable than traditional client-server systems.

It can enable tumours to be detected and localised based on their elasticity when they are less elastic than the surrounding soft tissue. In vibration sonoelastography the target tissues are vibrated while simultaneously recording ultrasound images. A technique for imaging relative elastic properties is proposed that uses a standard ultrasound machine. It combines B-scan and power Doppler signals to produce images of relative vibration amplitude. Preliminary results using simulations and liver phantoms are presented and the potential of the method to highlight areas of differing elasticity within an organ such as the breast is mentioned. The possibility of combining such a method with freehand 3D scanning, enabling B-scan and power Doppler signals to simultaneously populate a voxel array for subsequent visualisation is discussed.', null, 'application/pdf', 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.2037', 'en', '', '10.1.1.41.6201', 'Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it.', 'http://www.computing.dundee.ac.uk/staff/stephen/IASTED_2002_VC_Sono3D_preprint.pdf', 'Doppler ultrasound', 'Sonoelastography using Compensated Power Doppler', '3');

Parodi and  Bonelli (1990) applied the Boole LCS (Wilson,  1985) to a Lymphography data set and reported  82% classification rates. More recent work, such as  GA-Miner (Flockhart, 1995) has sought to extend  the application of LCS to larger commercial data  sets, introducing more complex attribute encoding  techniques, static niching, and hybrid genetic  operators in order to address the problems  presented by large search spaces. Despite these  results, the traditional LCS formulation has shown  itself to be unreliable in the formation of accurate  optimal generalisations, which are vital for the  reduction of results to a human readable form. XCS  (Wilson, 1995, 1998) has been shown to be capable  of generating a complete and optimally accurate  mapping of a test environment (Kovacs, 1996) and  therefore presents a new opportunity for the  application of Learning Classifier Systems to Data  Mining. As part of a continuing research effort this  paper presents some first results in the application  of XCS to a Data Mining task. It demonstrates that  XCS is able to produce a classification  performance and rule set which exceeds the  performance of most current Machine Learning  techniques when applied to the Monk&apos;s problems  (Thrun, 1991).', null, 'application/pdf', 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.2038', 'en', '', '10.1.1.161.4073', 'Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the oai identifier remains attached to it.', 'http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~amb/papers/LCSWS1999monks.pdf', null, 'XCS and the Monk&apos;s Problems', '3');
